    The flow of the internet: <br>
    "You" make a request to the internet that then sends an HTTP request to the server (which are pieces of hardware sitting in closets, storing files), the server then sends back the relevant info to the internet who then displays it to you!

    <br>
    <em><b>HTML</b> and what it is made of</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>HTML</b>: (Hypertext Markup Language), basis for everything on the web
    <br>
    HTML is made up of 
    text content ("what you see") and
    markup which dictates "what it looks like".<br>
    Text is normal text and markup is denoted by tags < >. 
  <br> <br>
  <b>HTML Tags and Elements</b>
  <br>
  HTML markup is made up of elements and tags. The element specifies what we want the computer to do that is "special" while the tags denote the element. 
  <br>
  There are <b>inline</b> elements and there are <b>block</b> elements. 
  Block elements create an invisible box of sorts around their content-- think of it like a form, etc. For any further information, check out this website: <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity.com</a> and head to the Intro to Programming Nanodegree. :]
